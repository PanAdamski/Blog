## Welcome 

Here I have taken away all the existing methods of privilege escalation in linux. <br>
These methods will be useful for CTFs, Pentester work and Certifications.<br>
I will try to present them, explain them and discuss them thoroughly.<br>

### sudo -l

Let's start with the simplest method I know `sudo -l`. <br>
A site that collects practically all the ill-configured binaries in linux [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/).<br>
Generally, this page contains all the escalation possibilities in this way and I recommend using it even if our escalation method is a bit more difficult (more on that later).<br>
Let's start with a simple example. I will discuss it in detail.<br>
The simplest configuration that exists is shown in the screenshot below.

With this configuration, the user can do everything with elevated privileges. In this case with the privileges of the <b>root</b> user. <br>

## sudo -l "with the additional condition"
